jetbrains-wakatime
==================

Fully automatic time tracking for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, RubyMine, PhpStorm, AppCode, WebStorm).

Installation
------------

Heads Up! WakaTime depends on [Python](http://www.python.org/getit/) being installed to work correctly.

1. Inside your IDE, select `Preferences` -> `Plugins` -> `Browse Repositories...`.

2. Search for `WakaTime`.
   
3. Click the green `Install Plugin` button.

4. Click `Close` and `OK`, then Re-launch your IDE.

5. You will see a prompt asking for your [api key](https://wakatime.com/#apikey). Enter your api key, then click `Save`.

6. Use your IDE like you normally do and your time will automatically be tracked for you.

7. Visit https://wakatime.com to see your logged time.
